There's a lot we learnt about Czech Republic, and I've written about it [here](https://mugdhak30.github.io//interesting_facts_Czech_Republic/). 


Old town is a whole other world!

Charles Bridge is certainly the life of Prague, with something always happening there. We walked along it in the morning, noon and even at dusk; and it was buzzing with tourists, musicians, artists, hawkers and almost reminded me of the evenings we spent at Marine Drive (Mumbai)!

I procrastinated writing this article under the pretext of being preoccupied with work. In reality, I felt that writing about Prague would mark the end of one of the best summers of my life. Even as frost warns us of a harsh winter, this summer filled me with enough warmth to last a lifetime. Until we cling on to the souvenirs, memories and the fun adventures Europe gave us, the summer will never end, right?
