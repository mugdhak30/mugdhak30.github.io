I miss traveling. The past few months have been hectic, to say the least. I’ve been buried in work, and the weather has been disappointing. I miss the train journeys, the joy of exploring new places. But do you know what I miss the most? Reliving these places by writing about them. This blog is my safe space. I cannot wake up in a new country everyday, but that shouldn’t stop me from writing about my life. Because I don’t know who I am if I’m not a writer. So here I am, celebrating the everyday! 

The grey season is upon us, and I’ve seen the sun very rarely since the past few months. Amidst all this grey, snow has been a lovely guest who just won’t stop showing up. As much as I hate the biting cold, I can’t take my eyes off of the scene: naked trees suddenly growing white beards (like Santa), tiny paw prints on snow covered lawn, steam rising from the streams across town. It’s a magical winter wonderland. And if you carefully layer up, it is something that you can really enjoy.

A month ago I felt the need to be reminded of everything and everyone who makes me happy. So, on a weekday evening, instead of opening my laptop and preparing for next day’s work, I did something childish. I created a “happiness” wall at home. I put up pictures of every animate or inanimate thing which brings happiness to me. Et voila! I now wake up to the view of everything that has ever truly mattered to me. I’m slowly realizing that my work is finding its way up on that wall. I spent most of the rare sunny days cooped up in my office, and took this photo of sun setting behind my office. Instead of resenting those four walls, I enjoyed this sunset and felt satisfied with the day. Only time will tell if this photo will make its way on the wall, but with regular breaks and a good work-life balance, I truly see that happening. It’s amazing how one little activity can change your whole mood! I suggest such seemingly childish things to survive the winter depression (which is very common in Germany).

TODO

I took to reading. Talk about doing "nothing" on Sundays. From enjoying ["Kaffee und Kuchen" (coffee and cake)](https://www.thelocal.de/20200902/kaffee-und-kuchen-a-very-german-tradition) in the backyard to lying down on the lawn with a book of poetry, I made the most of a couple of sunny Sundays. Cite [Sneha's blog](https://medium.com/@snehakhedkar/come-lets-sit-and-do-nothing-dfb0ffb39d62) and say "I'm not proud of it, but I'm the sister she's talking about".
