Heidelberg is a pair of mountains playfully dodging each other as the Neckar river flows between them. I could just sit by the river looking at the antique Old Bridge and watch time pass by. The landscape took me to a much older time, when as a kid I used to draw a cliched scenery: two mountains and a river flowing between them. And then it took me to a more recent (but still older) time, when I visited Laxman Jhula (Rishikesh, India) with my family. The memories made my heart fill with joy. It was simple, and simply beautiful.

The view from the castle was beautiful. The color coordinated adorable little houses were very pleasing to the eyes, and the view gave me a strange satisfaction. To be honest, it made me miss my sister a little bit. She would have loved this view (she loves everything symmetrically aesthetic)!
