Hi! I am Mugdha Khedkar. I am a PhD student advised by [Prof. Dr. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de/). I work as a Research Assistant in the [Secure Software Engineering group](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse/) at Paderborn University, Germany.

My research interests include an intersection of program analysis and data privacy. Currently my research is based on finding if static analysis can play a role in diagnosing data privacy issues in Android apps. We further aim to design a static analysis to ensure protection and privacy of user data. 

**We are looking for Android developers who can take this short survey and help us with our research:** [https://umfragen.uni-paderborn.de/index.php/785133?lang=en](https://umfragen.uni-paderborn.de/index.php/785133?lang=en_) ![](images/new.jpeg){:width="25"}
