Hi! I am Mugdha Khedkar. I am a PhD student advised by [Prof. Dr. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de/). I work as a Research Assistant in the [Secure Software Engineering group](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse/) at Paderborn University, Germany since February 2021.

My research interests include static analysis and formal verification. Currently my research is based on constructing a single, declarative representation of the most used security-relevant static analyses and then explore the area of self-adaptive static analyses. This research involves a variety of concepts from program analysis, programming, model checking and automated computing.
