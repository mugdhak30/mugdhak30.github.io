Hi! I am Mugdha Khedkar. I am a PhD student advised by [Prof. Dr. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de/). I work as a Research Assistant in the [Secure Software Engineering group](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse/) at Paderborn University, Germany since February 2021.

My research interests include an intersection of programming language and software security. Currently my research is based on finding optimizations for static analyses and exploring the possibility of static analyses optimizing themselves to a given target program. This involves a variety of concepts from program analysis, software security, formal verification and automated computing.
