Hi! I am Mugdha Khedkar. I am a PhD student advised by [Prof. Dr. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de/) in the [Secure Software Engineering group](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse/) at Paderborn University, Germany.
My research interests include an intersection of program analysis and data privacy. Currently I am exploring the role of static program analysis in ensuring protection and privacy of user data in Android apps.
