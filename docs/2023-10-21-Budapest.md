Intro. Link my [previous article on Budapest](https://mugdhak30.github.io/A-Tale-Of-Two-Cities/)

We woke up early in the morning to visit the [Szechenyi bath](https://bathsbudapest.com/szechenyi-bath), which is the biggest and the most popular thermal bath in Budapest.

Budapest is famous for its nightlife. While many European cities have a party culture, ruin bars are very unique and have become Budapest's trademark. These unusual drinking joints are situated inside neglected pre-war buildings of the old Jewish Quarter. They are decorated very creatively and have a chic style. We are not very interested in partying, so we visited the unique farmers' market in the most popular ruin bar,[Szimpla Kert](https://www.offbeatbudapest.com/places/szimpla-kert-ruin-bar/) (yes, we are old people trapped in young bodies). This beautiful bar reminded me of the Japanese art of [Kintsugi] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi), since it breathed a new life into the old lifeless building that had once witnessed the horrors of war. I am not sure how much I liked the decorations, but I laud the creativity and respect the concept of these bars. They make the Jewish quarter very youth-friendly, and definitely make Budapest effortlessly chic.

When I visited Budapest last time, our tour guide had told us that we had only explored half of what Budapest has to offer. The other half lies underneath the cobblestone streets of the Buda district and it buries with it many secrets of the past[^1]. Perhaps the most exciting activity of this trip was the [walking tour](https://www.getyourguide.com/budapest-l29/budapest-buda-castle-caves-walking-tour-t391260/) we took through Buda's unexplored caves. There's a whole labyrinth of caves underground still unaccounted for! Most of these caves were naturally created by the flowing waters of the thermal springs found in Budapest. These natural caves were later expanded and also repurposed to act as shelter during the second world war. We walked through a maze of passageways and natural limestone caverns and also explored the manmade parts of the labyrinth. We had booked a short tour, but it was long enough to have our mind blown!

Our guide explained that the man-made caves were originally to provide protection from fires. Apparently, family homes owned caves on multiple levels but didn't disclose all of them to the government so they could store grain items in the other caves (and avoid paying tax for it :D). Many private caves also had wells for pumping out drinking water. When plague struck their neighborhood, people stopped using these wells. Since Buda is a wine-growing region, people (and children) substituted delicious local wine for water. In the 1970s and 80s, people used to also host parties in their private caves, and the smoke circulated through the ventilation ducts caused quite a nuisance to the neighborhood. Our guide was full of such interesting facts, and walking through these caves while learning about their history was a unforgettable experience.
