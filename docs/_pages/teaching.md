**Teaching Assistance**
======

* [**Secure Software Engineering**](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse/lehre/sse) \\
Bachelor Course, Universität Paderborn (Summer 2024) \\
This course offers an introduction to the key areas of secure software engineering: threat modeling, secure design, secure coding, security validation, secure deployment and maintenance.

* **Seminar Secure Systems Engineering** \\
Master Course, Universität Paderborn (Winter 2023, Summer 2023)\\
This course offers a unique opportunity for students to understand and experience how scientific research is conducted.

* **Designing Code Analyses for Large-scale Software Systems I** \\
Master Course, Universität Paderborn (Winter 2022, Winter 2021)\\
This course covers several concepts in static code analysis: intra-procedural data-flow analysis, call-graph construction algorithms, context-insensitivity, pointer analysis, analysis frameworks (IFDS, IDE, VASCO).

* **Designing Code Analyses for Large-scale Software Systems II** \\
Master Course, Universität Paderborn (Summer 2022, Summer 2021)\\
This course covers several novel, advanced concepts in static code analysis: sparse IFDS, pushdown systems, demand-driven program analysis, hybrid analysis and improved user experience.

**Thesis Supervision**
=====
I have supervised the following Master theses:

1) Automated Privacy Assessment for Android Applications: A DPV Visualisation Approach (ongoing) \\
2) Explaining Privacy-Relevant Program Slices to App Developers (ongoing) \\
3) Automatically Generating Data Safety Section Labels for Android Apps \\
4) Improving User Experience of Program Slicing wrt Data Privacy \\
5) Labeling User-Input Privacy Data in Android Applications \\
6) Empirical Evaluation of Forward and Backward Taint Analysis \\
7) Qualitative Study of Data Flow Analysis Frameworks: IFDS, IDE and VASCO

For students seeking a thesis topic, organizational information [on my webpage](https://mugdhak30.github.io/info_for_students/) and on the [SSE webpage](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse/lehre/bachelor-masterarbeiten) might interest you.
