Here are some interesting and fun facts I learnt on our trip to Prague:
 
* Czech Republic has the largest number of castles in the world (2000). It is also called the "Castle Capital" of the world!
* The Czechs drink more beer than anyone else in the world, on an average, 160 litres per person per year! 
* It is one of the least religious countries in the world, with almost 80 percent being athiests.
* Czech Republic has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union.
* Charles University, founded in 1348, is one the oldest universities in the Czech Republic and one of the oldest universities in Europe. 
* The first stone of the Charles Bridge in Prague was set on the 9th July 1357 at 5:31 am by King Charles IV himself. The King believed in numerology. He picked this exact time because it is a palindrome when written out: 1-3-5-7-9-7-5-3-1 (year, day, month, then time).
* The first music to be played on moon was Czech! Neil Armstrong played Czech composer Antonin Dvorakâ€™s New World Symphony on the moon. 
* Czech Republic is the greatest toy exporter in Europe.
* Czech doctor Jan Jansky was the first to divide blood into four blood groups in 1907. 
* The [Town Hall Clock](https://voicemap.me/tour/prague/exploring-prague-s-jewish-quarter/sites/the-town-hall-clock) in Prague's Jewish Quarter is a backward Hebrew clock, and is the only backward clock in the world.
