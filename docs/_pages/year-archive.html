<p> On a beautiful summer morning, while travelling on the train I realised how lucky I am to be spending my twenties in Europe... </p>

<p>This is a small attempt to document and share some memories I make while travelling across Europe and also all the interesting things I learn along the way. If I am lucky enough, this blog will also have travelogues from other continents. And if I find time or just want to zone out from the PhD stress, I will write about my past experiences travelling around my own country, India. </p>

<p> Stay tuned :)</p>
