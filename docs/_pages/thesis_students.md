**For students doing a Thesis with me:** 

I take thesis supervision very seriously and I expect dedication from your side. These are a few things I would like you to keep in mind for the duration of the thesis:

* Since the pandemic, all our meetings will happen on Skype. Please be active on Skype.
* I prefer having weekly meetings of thirty minutes. If you want to cancel a meeting, please tell me at least two days in advance so I can rework my schedule.
* To make the best use of our time, I recommend structuring the meeting as follows:
	* Summary of the tasks conducted over the past one week
	* Challenges faced or problems that need attention
	* Plan for the next one week
* If you have specific doubts, you can ping me on Skype. However, I request you to respect my working hours (9 am to 7 pm). Please don't ping me at odd hours, unless there's a deadline the next day.
* Some useful resources for students: [Thesis guide](https://thesisguide.org/), [How to write a great Masters thesis (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC_fIWKbCa0).
