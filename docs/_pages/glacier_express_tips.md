Disclaimer: I am not an expert. These are just the things we kept in mind to have a good experience.

Here are some interesting and tips and tricks you can use to have a great experience aboard the Glacier express: 
 
* Your Glacier Express ticket is included with a [Swiss travel pass](https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/tickets/guests-abroad/swiss-travel-pass.html), but you’ll still need to reserve a seat. We had a second-class Swiss Travel Pass, and we reserved a first-class seat (seat reservations cost 49 CHF for both second and first class). At Zurich Hauptbahnhof (central station), we were able to upgrade our Swiss travel pass to first class for that route, so we traveled in luxury! 

* The Glacier express is a panaromic train, with gigantic reflecting windows. This means that any photos you take will likely have some sun glare. However, there’s a trick: some windows near the doors of the compartment can open, and we got some fantastic shots from there. Since we were in first class (and many people didn’t know about this trick), we had those windows all to ourselves :D 

* On sunny days, the train can get a little warm. Layer up, and make sure you have summer clothes underneath ;)

* If you want to catch the [Landwasser Viaduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landwasser_Viaduct), board from St. Moritz (in the direction of Zermatt). We boarded from Chur, since that was the most convenient when traveling from Zurich.

* For the first three hours, we sat on the right side of the train (which offered views of the Swiss Grand Canyon). The Oberalp Pass and Andermatt scenery were more prominent on the left side of the train. In the last three hours, we switched to the left side. Both sides offer amazing views, but keep in mind that the train changes direction at Chur.

* Meals are not included with a first class ticket (they’re only part of the Excellence Class experience). To save some money, we packed our own lunch. Outside food is allowed on the train.

* The train’s gift shop has souvenirs, but they’re quite expensive. If you’re looking for more affordable Glacier Express mementos, you might find better prices in Zermatt.

* The train has Wifi, but the connection is not very strong throughout the journey.

* The train has several key highlights. When you hear a “gong,” it’s time to plug in your earphones and enjoy the commentary.

* The crew onboard is very helpful and fluent in English. So reach out to them if you have any issues. 

* Many people think that taking any regional trains with the same route are a cheaper way of enjoying the same experience. While it’s true that regional trains are cheaper, the Glacier Express is a panoramic luxury experience, and if you’re looking for that extra level of comfort, it’s totally worth the cost. If you're on a tight budget, it might not be the best option, but for us, the experience was absolutely worth every penny we spent!
