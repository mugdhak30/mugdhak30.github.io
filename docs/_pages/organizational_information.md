**For students seeking a Thesis topic:** 

* Our group advertises open thesis topics [here](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/sse/lehre/bachelor-masterarbeiten).
* If you are interested in doing a thesis with me, send an email only if you have passed the course Designing Code Analyses for Large-scale Software Systems I.
* The course Designing Code Analyses for Large-scale Software Systems II is not an essential prerequisite.  
* Please attach your transcript and CV with the email. 
* In case you have a thesis topic in mind, I would be happy to schedule a call to discuss it. Please attach a small abstract with the email. 
* Please give me three to four working days to respond to your email. I try to respond to all emails. In the rare case where you don't receive a reply, please assume that I don't have any more capacity to supervise students.
