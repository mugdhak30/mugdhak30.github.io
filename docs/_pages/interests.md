I am an avid reader. I am also an author of more than 270 English poems, some of which can be found on my [poetry profile](https://allpoetry.com/Mugdhak).

I like to travel. I try to share some of my travel adventures on my [blog](https://mugdhak30.github.io/year-archive/). 

Some of my favourite quotes ...

   * Poetry is when an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found words. - Robert Frost

   * I have got promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep! - Robert Frost [(Full poem)](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42891/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening)

   * Two roads diverged in a wood, and I \\
    I took the one less traveled by,  \\
    And that has made all the difference. - Robert Frost  [(Full poem)](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken)
    
   * Leaving behind nights of terror and fear \\
    I rise \\
    Into a daybreak that is wondrously clear \\
    I rise \\
    Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, \\
    I am the dream and the hope of the slave. \\
    I rise! - Maya Angelou [(Full poem)](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46446/still-i-rise)

   * O, wind, if winter comes, can spring be far behind? - Percy Bysshe Shelley [(Full poem)](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45134/ode-to-the-west-wind)

   * He who binds to himself a joy \\
   Does the winged life destroy; \\
   But he who kisses the joy as it flies \\
   Lives in eternity's sunrise. - William Blake

   * Happy the man, and happy he alone, \\
   He who can call today his own; \\
   He who, secure within, can say, \\
   Tomorrow, do thy worst, for I have lived today. - John Dryden
