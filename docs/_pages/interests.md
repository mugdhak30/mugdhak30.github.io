**Personal Interests**

I am an avid reader. I am also an author of more than 265 English poems, some of which can be found on my [poetry profile](https://allpoetry.com/Mugdhak).

Some of my favourite quotes ...

   * Poetry is when an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found words. - Robert Frost

   * I have got promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep! - Robert Frost

   * Two roads diverged in a wood, and I \\
    I took the one less traveled by,  \\
    And that has made all the difference. - Robert Frost
    
   * Leaving behind nights of terror and fear \\
    I rise \\
    Into a daybreak that is wondrously clear \\
    I rise \\
    Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, \\
    I am the dream and the hope of the slave. \\
    I rise! - Maya Angelou

   * O, wind, if winter comes, can spring be far behind? - Percy Bysshe Shelley
