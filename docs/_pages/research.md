**Research**
=====
Our work is centred around the design and implementation of static program analyses to ensure data protection in Android apps. 

Lack of data privacy and protection has been a long-standing problem in the digital world, and it has gained a lot of attention since the European Union rolled out the General Data Protection Regulation [(GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/). The growing demand for privacy by design necessitates that app developers use technical measures to protect their users' privacy. However, app developers lack legal expertise and hence find it difficult to understand how they can protect users' data, or even *which* data they should protect. Loosely written privacy policies and data safety section (Google Play Store) are a good example of how app developers need tool support in reasoning about data protection.

Static analysis checks the source code thoroughly before execution, and covers all of the app’s possible execution paths. It has been extensively used to assist developers in identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities. Our approach broadens the scope of static analysis to cover user privacy and data protection. Our envisioned analysis will help app developers reason about data protection proactively, and it will also assist auditors in performing efficient privacy audits.
