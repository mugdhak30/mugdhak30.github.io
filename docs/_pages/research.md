**Research**
=====
Our work is centered around the design and implementation of static program analyses to ensure data protection in Android apps. 

Lack of data privacy and protection has gained a lot of attention since the European Union rolled out the General Data Protection Regulation [(GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/). The growing demand for privacy by design necessitates that app developers use technical measures to protect their users' privacy. However, app developers lack legal expertise and hence find it difficult to understand how they can protect users' data, or even *which* data they should protect. Loosely written privacy policies and data safety section (Google Play Store) are a good example of how app developers need tool support in reasoning about data protection.

Static analysis checks the source code thoroughly before execution, and covers all of the app’s possible execution paths. It has been extensively used to assist developers in identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities. Our approach broadens the scope of static analysis to cover user privacy and data protection. Our envisioned analysis will help app developers reason about data protection proactively, and it will also assist legal experts like Data Protection Officers in performing efficient privacy assessments. 

If you are an app developer, a Data Protection Officer, or an auditor and are interested in collaborating or learning more about our work, please [contact me](mailto:mugdha.khedkar@upb.de).

**Research Interests**
=====

I have worked on static program analysis, data privacy and protection, and conducted empirical and usability-driven studies surrounding such analyses. I am open to working on broader topics in the future. 

I’m actively seeking postdoctoral positions starting summer 2026. If you’re interested in collaborating or have opportunities, please feel free to <a href="mugdha.khedkar@upb.de"><strong>get in touch</strong></a>!
