**Research and Publications**
=====

Our research focuses on designing static program analyses to ensure data protection in Android apps.

With the rise of privacy regulations like the EU’s GDPR, developers face increasing pressure to implement privacy-by-design measures. However, many lack legal expertise and struggle to understand which data to protect or how to enforce it, as seen in loosely written privacy policies and Google Play data safety sections.

Static analysis thoroughly examines source code before execution, covering all possible paths. We extend this technique to help developers proactively safeguard user data and assist legal experts, such as Data Protection Officers, in conducting efficient privacy assessments.

If you are an app developer, Data Protection Officer, or auditor interested in collaborating, please [contact me](mailto:mugdha.khedkar@upb.de).

## Research Interests

I have worked on static program analysis, data privacy and protection, and conducted empirical and usability-driven studies surrounding such analyses. I am open to working on broader topics in the future. 

I’m actively seeking postdoctoral positions starting summer or fall 2026. If you’re interested in collaborating or have opportunities, please feel free to <a href="mugdha.khedkar@upb.de"><strong>get in touch</strong></a>!
