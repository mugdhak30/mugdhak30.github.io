When I wrote about Burano, I said that every town in Europe need not have "royalty and grandeur oozing out of it", but some towns in Europe are straight up unreal! I mean, there's just no way such royalty can exist right? Well, it does. This beautiful city from the Tuscany region in Italy was like a work of Renaissance art and just the sight of its city center is enough to make artists cry tears of joy!

Florence was in stark contrast with Burano, and traveling to both these just one day apart was a cultural shock, to say the least. Thanks to the short days, I saw most of Florence in the dark, and that really added a different charm to the whole experience. Would I love to see it during the day? Sure. But well lit nights in December are much brighter than dull winter days, so I have nothing to complain about!

Write about Florence. Michelangelo's art is displayed all over the city. http://www.aboutflorence.com/Itineraries-in-Florence/michelangelo.html

Florence Baptistery has the most gorgeous doors. Michelangelo named these as Gates of Paradise. The doors consist of 10 rectangular panels, displayed in two lines. They depict scenes of the Old Testament from left to right and from top to bottom. In each panel, Ghiberti described more than one scene so that there are over fifty scenes depicted. Our tour guide explained some of the scenes to us and the atmosphere there was just out of this world. This is how I spent Christmas: visiting places significant for Christians.

Something about that church where Galileo is buried.
