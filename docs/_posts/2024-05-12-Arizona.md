We got a chance to spend three days in Arizona when we visited the [Grand Canyon](https://mugdhak30.github.io/Grand-Canyon/), and slowly realized that Arizona's magic extends beyond the canyon's depths. The state had plenty of surprises for us, making our trip a rollercoaster ride!

We started our trip from Phoenix, and were immediately greeted by Arizona's iconic cacti. Every half an hour, we drove through a new visual treat, from gigantic rocks to picturesque roads. Every town we crossed had something in store for us, but Sedona surpassed all expectations. Suddenly, a gigantic group of red rocky formations appeared out of nowhere, leaving us in awe!

We took a break at [Sedona](https://visitsedona.com/) and decided to explore some hiking trails. Climbing on to the red rocks felt like exploring a part of Mars! Despite my fear of heights, I could climb quite a bit, and was rewarded with unique views. The trails were well marked and every viewpoint offered us breathtaking views of the desert sprinkled with clusters of trees.

As we hit the road again, our journey took an unexpected turn. Despite all the planning we did for this trip, we never guessed that we would end up driving through a snow storm! The road trip was adventurous, and my partner did an amazing job of calmly driving us through the storm. By the time we reached our destination, it felt like we had been on the road for ages, experiencing every season in one trip. Thankfully, a beautiful wooden cabin awaited us in the little town of [Williams](https://experiencewilliams.com/), offering us comfort at the end of a very tiring day.

After spending an amazing day exploring the [Grand Canyon](https://mugdhak30.github.io/Grand-Canyon/), we decided to stop at [Flagstaff](https://www.flagstaffarizona.org/) on the drive back to Phoenix. It was a nice clear day and we strolled around a serene lake. Flagstaff boasts some of the cleanest air in the world, and seemed to be a very quiet town.

I was really looking forward to our next stop: the [Lowell Observatory](https://lowell.edu/) in Flagstaff! Though we missed the chance to visit after sunset, we spent the most magical afternoon touring the observatory. We engaged in some solar viewing through advanced telescopes. And guess what? This is where the dwarf planet Pluto was discovered! We took a guided tour through the observatory, checked out many old and powerful telescopes, and watched a special documentary on the total solar eclipse that would grace some parts of the U.S. on 8th April 2024.

Finally, we entered the Pluto dome to learn about the intriguing history of Pluto, the ninth planet which was demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006. We saw the well preserved telegram that was sent by a 12-year old English girl in 1930 suggesting the name "Pluto" for the tiny planet. Surprisingly, the [telescope that had first discovered Pluto](https://lowell.edu/discover/telescopes-exhibits/pluto-discovery-telescope/) is still operational, and we had a chance to see it! This transported me back to my childhood days of visiting the Nehru Planetarium in Mumbai, evoking a sense of nostalgia. I was awe-struck! It seemed like just yesterday when we were learning about the planets in our solar system using the mnemonic: My Very Educated Mother Just Showed Us Nine Planets. Standing at the very spot where one of those planets was discovered was absolutely surreal.

This afternoon meant a lot to me. I have been very excited about astronomy since I was a little kid, and it was amazing to have visited this place with my partner, who shared my enthusiasm. After that adrenaline rush, it was time to drive back to Phoenix. The views along the way were magical, and the weather was kinder to us this time. We came back home with full hearts, plenty of souvenirs, and special memories that we will share with our future kids as exciting bedtime stories.
