My trip to Northern California started off as one I took just to meet my partner. However, it ended as one with several once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and I couldn't have asked for better company through it.

We had planned a trip to [Santa Cruz](https://www.cityofsantacruz.com/) and one of my family friends suggested that we go on a whale watching tour. Whales migrate from Alaska to Mexico for summer and we were hoping to spot them somewhere near the Monterey bay. So we booked a [whale watching tour](https://www.santacruzwhalewatching.com/)[^1] and spent around 3 hours in the sea. At one point we had hundreds of [Risso's dolphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risso%27s_dolphin) around our boat, all putting on an amazing show for us. Our team leader Sydney explained to us how we were approaching them slowly to ensure their safety. As we went deeper into the ocean, we saw some glorious Grey Whales (and now it was time for us to stay a little far to ensure our safety). Sydney has shared some professional photos [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cb5OY1yrKNH/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=). The weather Gods were very helpful but the Pacific ocean was punishing us for disturbing its "peace". The ride was amazing but very turbulent. We were terribly seasick by the time the tour ended, so it was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for us :)

While coming back from Santa Cruz, we took the scenic Pacific Coast Highway ([Highway 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1)). This sea-hugging road is out of the world (quite literally) and even getting a cell connection there is a challenge. The coast in this part of California is lined with high cliffs and gorgeous views of the Pacific. We parked our car at one such cliff to enjoy the view of the [Shark Fin Cove beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32282-d10598228-Reviews-Shark_Fin_Cove-Davenport_California.html). It was super windy, the cliff was really high and the ocean was more violent that ever (the Pacific seriously needs to take a chill pill). Even though I'm a little afraid of water, I go on boats and beaches. Even though I'm a little afraid of heights, I've visited the Himalayas and other mountains. This cliff, however, brought out all my fears together! At one point I sat down in protest and said "I'm not going any further". Rahul went to the top of the cliff and was kind enough to bring me some breathtaking photos of the view. This adrenaline rush was enough for us to decide to not trek down to the Cove. Driving along this road while listening to Bollywood travel songs is an experience I'm never going to forget in my life, and I've tried to immortalize it by penning it down.

On my way back to Germany, I took a window seat because I had heard that the takeoff over San Francisco is gorgeous. And gosh, that decision was rewarding! Goodbyes are hearbreaking for a long-distance couple and they're the worst when they also mark the end of a perfect vacation. Just as I was returning to reality, nature went out of the way to light up my dark night. We flew over Greenland at night and I had the company of [Northern Lights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora) dancing outside my window for a good half an hour. Thanks to the Lufthansa on board Wi-Fi (best 7 euros I've ever spent), I could share this experience with my sister. While the others on my flight were fast asleep, my sister and I were freaking out: watching the Northern lights was on both our traveling bucket lists! We were already making plans to fly to Finland to see them again, this time from the ground. It's been over a week now but I still remember them clearly floating near the wing of our aircraft. This was another reason why I took a window seat, but I still can't believe I got to watch them from the comfort of my seat!

A recent Marathi movie had a dialogue: "प्रवासात माणूस जुन्याचा नवा होतो!" (Translation: Travel transforms you into a new person)! I truly felt that in this trip: the woman almost crying looking at the Northern lights wasn't the same woman who left Germany three weeks ago. The laughs I shared with my partner as we watched the sun go down into the Pacific made me feel like I'm the luckiest person in the world. Sometimes our smiles sit miles away on the other side of the world, and if we go chasing after them they have the power to turn any strange new place into home!
