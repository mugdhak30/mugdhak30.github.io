The many half-timbered houses sprinkled across the country make German landscapes every poet's muse! They make German towns stand apart from the rest of Europe. I am very lucky to wake up to the view of one such pretty house everyday, but I still cannot get enough of it! So when I told my friend how much I love them, she said "Wait till you visit Monschau!" The little girl in me dreaming about living in these little houses just couldn't wait, so I visited this half-timbered heaven just before 2021 drew to a close!

Monschau is a charming little town near the Belgian border. It is known for its romantic lanes and rows of half-timbered houses that seem to be unchanged since centuries. This is the first German town I have visited that seems to be untouched by industrialization. It is a town so comfortable in its own antique beauty, that I don't think it has felt the need to adapt to the 21st century at all!

This fairy tale town makes you forget time, and suddenly your worries are things of the past. One half-timbered house follows the other; and all shops, boutiques, cafes, hotels and even banks are half-timbered! Add to it a little river that flows through the heart of the town, and you have for yourself a town that is straight out of a dream.

As is the case with most European towns, Monschau also has a castle overlooking the town. I could not capture good photos of the castle, but this castle was very different from the others I've seen so far. It has been turned into a youth hostel and many music festivals are held here. It reminded us of the forts (किल्ले) back home in Maharashtra. The cold weather with light drizzle reminded me of the Mumbai-Pune expressway and the many Mumbai-Pune-Mumbai trips I've made when I studied in Pune. 

The view from the castle was of a village full of gorgeous houses spread across the Eifel hills! It was a peaceful and symmetrical view that again reminded me of my sister (I will often mention her in my posts because I miss her a lot). This little town was in no rush. Since I come from a city that never sleeps, the quiet and peace in places like Monschau (and even Paderborn) was an initial shock for me. I slowly got used to it, and started enjoying it very much.

Monschau specially attracts tourists in winter after it has snowed. I can only imagine how wonderful the town would look when blanketed with snow, much like little treats sprinkled with powdered sugar on top. [Here](https://www.eifelsteig.de/images/kaopcencpdk-/bezauberndes-monschau-im-winter.jpg) is an example of how this would look perhaps one month later. While I missed this view, I was immensely grateful for the view in front of me.

We were a little unlucky with the weather the day we visited Monschau. It was freezing cold and as drizzle turned into windy rain, we took shelter in a little cafe near the river. Drinking hot chocolate and eating pommes frittes (french fries) with friends and listening to the playful chatter of the river Rur warmed us all up! It is funny how one place can revive so many memories of the past! Listening to the river took me back to the first few months of my life in Germany when I lived right besides the river Pader. I spent many hours sipping coffee, staring outside my window looking at Pader and constantly worrying about my future in this country. I wish I could tell that girl that slowly she will make it, all on her own in a new country! I wish I could tell her that she will travel, meet new people, miss home but still be happy!

As we start another year with nothing but hope in our heart, I hope we find time to pause, and reflect back at the life we've led so far. Happy new year, everyone! Thanks for reading my blog and supporting me in this new venture. Writing has been my dream since forever and I hope to share much more with you all in the coming years!
