2023 started slow for me but soon I was stargazing in the deserts of California, flying alongside the Northern lights, exploring the land of Kangaroos and spending a dreamy summer on the Adriatic coast. But for the final hurrah of the year, I craved the warmth of my family and friends. So, I wrapped up the year in India, the first home I have ever known and loved. 

At the end of every year, I get tired of adulting. So, I do what I've been doing since my school days — I pack my bag and run home, just like that eager schoolgirl rushing out of class to update her twin sister about the day. And guess what? Just like those good old days, she was waiting for me at the arrival gate, eyes sparkling with excitement. After a much needed reunion with my family, we traveled to Rajasthan to explore the great Indian desert and create some unforgettable memories.

Though I've been to the state of Rajasthan twice before, I had not stepped into the [Thar desert](https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/thar-desert/). We opted for a resort near the desert to get the true experience, and calling it peaceful would be an understatement. Rajasthan is known for its hospitality, and the resort totally lived up to the hype. Staying in those cottages felt royal, even in a rural setting. Our [resort](https://www.manvar.com/stay/manvar-shergarh-the-desert-resort.html) was an oasis in the middle of nowhere, a perfect spot for a family to reconnect at the end of a tiring year.

Our first adventure was a jeep safari to the parts of the desert that could not be reached by any other cars. The desert surprised us: it was rugged, had many trees and fewer sandy stretches than we expected. Oh, but those scanty sandy patches were exceptional! Racing across those sand dunes in a jeep felt straight out of a thriller movie. We spotted [Nilgai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgai), deer and many birds. It was awesome seeing them in their natural habitat.

We planned the safari so we could watch the sun set from our jeep. It was breathtaking, perhaps one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. And as the desert gulped the sun, the temperature dipped so much that we decided to call it a day.

We spent a lot of the next day chilling by the pool, but had something special planned for the evening. My sister and I decided to go for a camel ride! It was amazing, and enduring 30 minutes on that camel was a true test of our core strength. Our camel's name was "Bhura" (translation: Brown) and he had traveled from a distant village to come meet us. Thanks to the "camel fail" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aNaNyWF4dY) my partner sent me one day before I sat on a camel, I was petrified. Luckily, Bhura was a perfect gentleman. Thanks to him, I finally know what it feels like to be tall! :D

A cultural program awaited us as as we returned to the resort at night. It featured local artists, whose incredible art lit up our evening. The introductory song, ["Padharo Mhare Desh" (come to my land)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq9UfNG1pRc) gave me instant goosebumps and that moment made me realize just how much I miss living in India. It hit me then —I'm so fortunate to be able to explore this country, even though I'm living in another continent. I can travel the entire world, but I will always be most fascinated to uncover more of India.

Our short stay near the desert ended with us chilling by the fireplace at night, listening to our father share anecdotes from his childhood. It was heartwarming to see how small, seemingly ordinary memories imprinted in someone's mind get passed down to the next generation in the form of beautiful stories. Great food, cool weather and endless chit-chats - the night couldn't have been better—until it was! We were quite literally in the middle of nowhere, and the starry skies that greeted us were fascinating. It wasn't Milky Way season yet, but the sky was more interesting than ever. The showstopper of the night was undoubtedly Jupiter, and it was beautifully illuminating the night sky. We experimented with the tripod, phone cameras and a DSLR and finally managed to click some decent shots of the night.

Returning to your roots every now and then is the best way to stay grounded. I am lucky to have the chance to do this every year, and I will never take that for granted. Happy new year, dear readers! I hope the year is kind to you, and thanks for letting me bring you along on my adventures around the world.
