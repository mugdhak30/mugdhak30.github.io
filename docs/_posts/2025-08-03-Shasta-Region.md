The second leg of our Northern California road trip took us away from the coast but kept us close to nature—in the world of lakes, waterfalls and caves! We soon realized that this was definitely one of the most offbeat places we had ever decided to explore.

The scenery shifted quite drastically as we left Eureka and drove to [Redding](https://visitredding.com/)—from thick redwood trees to mountain ranges and rivers with clear water. It was a beautiful drive, especially for the passenger princess :) We made a quick stop at [Whiskeytown lake](https://www.nps.gov/whis/index.htm), a crystal-clear lake surrounded by hills. The lake was quiet, the water chilly, and dipping our feet in after hours on the road felt nothing short of divine. What was meant to be a quick stop slowly turned into a peaceful afternoon by the lake.

One of the highlights of our trip was our trip to [Burney falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burney_Falls). We’d seen dreamy pictures of it on Instagram, and learning that Theodore Roosevelt once called it the "Eighth Wonder of the World" only made us more hyped. So imagine our surprise when we parked barely 50 meters away and couldn’t hear a single hint of falling water. But as we walked a little farther, the falls revealed themselves—suddenly and dramatically—and yes, they were just as magical as we had hoped.

There were many well marked hiking trails around the falls, and we picked one that looped around the falls, giving us views from almost every angle. The weather was just right—sunny, breezy, perfect for a stroll through dense forest and over a little wooden bridge crossing a creek. I remember stopping every now and then to catch my breath, reading the thoughtful quotes carved into benches along the trail. One in particular stayed with us: “It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover” — J. Poincaré. As researchers, the quote struck a chord. It was the most meaningful way to spend an afternoon in the Shasta region.

We had reserved the final days of our trip to explore the [Shasta lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasta_Lake), which was very close to Redding. The lake had a truly fascinating shape—four winding arms fed by different rivers, almost like it was reaching out in every direction. We tried to explore a few trails along the lake, hoping to find a hidden gem or two, but nothing particularly stood out. What did stand out was how we ended up getting completely lost—Google Maps insisted there was a road where there clearly wasn’t. So we parked somewhere random, walked a long stretch in hope, and eventually discovered that the “spot” we were looking for didn’t exist. It was frustrating in the moment, but gave us a good laugh later! Thankfully, we still had one last thing to look forward to—the cave tour we had booked for our final day. We were pretty excited to end the trip on a high note...

Visiting [Lake Shasta Caverns](https://www.lakeshastacaverns.com/) was like cramming multiple little adventures into one big day. It started with a scenic boat ride across the  Shasta Lake, followed by a winding bus journey up the mountain. Our driver had a wicked sense of humor—at one point he joked, “If you’re scared of heights, now’s the time to close your eyes… just like I’m about to!” Safe to say, the mood stayed light all the way to the top. The view from the top was stunning—miles of lake stretching in every direction. We slowly descended into the cool darkness of the caves, ready to explore all they had to offer.

The limestone caves were nestled in the foothills of Mt. Shasta, 900 feet above Shasta Lake. Our tour guide told us the fascinating history of the caverns. Inside, we stood in awe before towering stalactites and the most magnificient rock formations. The tour ended with a gentle sound-and-light show, casting shadows and colors across the cavern walls. It was beautiful and strangely moving. We left the caves in silence, completely mesmerized.

This road trip wasn’t glamorous or bucket-list famous. We spent most of it chasing quiet trails, overlooked lakes and waterfalls, and half-marked paths that didn’t always lead where we thought they would. And somehow, that made it even more meaningful—like we’d stumbled into a hidden chapter of California we never knew existed. It was the kind of slow, grounding escape that catches you off guard in the best way. The kind you don’t realize you needed until it’s time to return to city life.
