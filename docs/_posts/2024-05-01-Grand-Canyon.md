After the most heartwarming start to the new year, I spent a few months buried in submission deadlines and research. My urge to travel grew stronger, but I would have never guessed that my first big adventure of the year would be majestic in every imaginable way!

I flew to the U.S. to meet my partner, and we decided to explore the [Grand Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm). Knowing how huge the Grand Canyon is, we realized we couldn't see it all in a couple of days. So we decided to go on a plane tour, and our first glimpse of the Canyon was unforgettable!

The flight was smooth, and the weather was perfect to take in the breathtaking view. It was as if an artist had splashed the most gorgeous colors and shapes onto a blank canvas, creating a timeless masterpiece. We flew over the confluence of the Little Colorado river and Colorado river, where the turquoise-colored water of the Little Colorado river blended with the muddy water of the larger Colorado river.

We soon flew over the snowy north rim of the Canyon, feeling as though we were flying through multiple seasons at once. While flying back to the airport, we saw the long line of cars waiting to enter the Grand Canyon National Park. Our captain cheekily said, "If only they knew what they are missing out on!". We knew we would soon join that traffic, but flying over one of the world's natural wonders was the best start to our adventure.

I was excited because visiting the Grand Canyon has been my mom's dream for as long as I can remember. But a lot of that excitement wore off when I looked down from the rim and was absolutely terrified of the height. My partner was immensely patient with me and I'm sure he got a glimpse of the kind of tantrums he might have to endure in the future. While he went for a short hike in the canyon, I had an awesome time walking along the rim. We spent a good part of the afternoon exploring the rim trails and discovering many breathtaking viewpoints.

Our afternoon turned out to be quite an adventure, not because of what we did, but because of what we witnessed. Suddenly, all my worries paled compared to the dangers some careless tourists were risking for insta-worthy photos. I overheard a mother caution her son, "If you fall, I can't come get you!" It was ridiculous how reckless some people were being, but perhaps some people's bucket list included a fall into nature's lap ðŸ™‰. Maybe if they had flown over the Grand Canyon, they would have thought twice, realizing that most parts of the canyon are so deep that they cannot even be seen from the land!

After spending an unforgettable day, it was time for my favorite part of any trip: the sunset. We found a gorgeous spot to watch the sun set over the canyon, and we prepared for one of the most beautiful sunsets we have ever seen. The sun peeped quite a bit over the western edge of the canyon, casting a spectacular reflection on the eastern cliffs, and finally dropped to end our day at one of the world's most beautiful places. I felt very blessed to share the sunset with my most favorite person, reminiscing about the beautiful sunsets we have been lucky enough to witness on our travels across the world.

The more I explore the U.S., the more I'm shocked by the grandeur of this country. It's astonishing how easily one can feel lonely, even in the midst of a bustling crowd at a place as immense as the Grand Canyon. The vastness is overwhelming, and makes one feel insignificant in front of nature's magnificence. Yet, such places offer the perfect opportunity to disconnect from the real world and reunite with a best friend. That evening, we were just two travelers borrowing a moment from the canvas of life, content in each other's company. These are the moments we live for and the ones we'll cherish for a lifetime.
