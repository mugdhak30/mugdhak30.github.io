One colorful little house followed the other as they lined up by the most beautiful canals, canals which found a way to shine bright even on such a dull day. Narrow old bridges connected one side of the canal to the other and all houses seemed to have their own boat (just like in Alappuzha). To be honest, I needed a moment to gather my thoughts as I stared at Burano. I also managed to click some decent photos despite my frozen hands (no, I don't exaggerate: FROZEN hands).
