Of course, our trip to Belgium was packed with plenty of waffle breaks, but we took things up a notch with a truffle-making class in Brussels! It was a fun group activityâ€”we were there with three other couples, and it kind of felt like getting a glimpse of our future! One couple had little kids who were loving every second of making (and munching on) chocolate. Then there was a middle-aged couple, probably empty nesters, who were energetic and even finished their truffles first! And finally, there was an older couple, probably in their seventies, who were so full of enthusiasm and joy.

Aside from the yummy truffles we made and brought home, this experience was unique because it made us appreciate these small, sweet moments. Sometimes, when you travel far enough, you catch a glimpse of your own future!

Sometimes if you travel far enough, you see your future!
