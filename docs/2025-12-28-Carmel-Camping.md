Squeezed in a short holiday before we got busy with work.

Intro to Airbnb. Hot tub and the hilly views. Missing the sunset but still catching a glimpse of the golden hour. 

That evening brought news I had been waiting over a year to hear on the work front, news I had nearly given up hoping for. With a glass of wine in hand, soaking in the hot tub, and sharing the moment with my husband, the evening felt very special. It was as though a weight I had been carrying for far too long finally lifted: the ache of time apart from my husband and the self-doubt I had been holding onto at work, shaped by factors completely beyond my control. Without a doubt, it became one of the most memorable evenings of the year.
