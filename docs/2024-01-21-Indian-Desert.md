I traveled a lot in 2023. But for the final hurrah of the year, I craved the warmth of my family and friends. So, I wrapped up the year in India, the first home I have ever known and loved.

Cultural programs. Talk about the abundant culture of the country. The introductory song, ["Padharo Mhare Desh" (come to my land)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq9UfNG1pRc) gave me instant goosebumps and that moment made me realize just how much I miss living in India. It hit me then —I'm so fortunate to be able to explore this country, even though I'm living in another continent. I can travel the entire world, but I will always be most fascinated to uncover more of India.

*Cultural program at the resort*

Chilling by the fireplace at night got our father nostalgic and he recounted anecdotes and stories from his childhood. It was heartwarming to see how small, seemingly ordinary memories imprinted in someone's mind get passed down to the next generation in the form of beautiful stories. Great food, cool weather and endless chit-chats - the night couldn't have been better—until it was! We were quite literally in the middle of nowhere, and the starry skies that greeted us were fascinating. The staff of our resort was kind enough to switch off some lights so we could enjoy the experience. It wasn't Milky Way season yet, but the sky was more interesting than ever. The showstopper of the night was undoubtedly Jupiter, and it was beautifully illuminating the night sky. We experimented with the tripod, phone cameras and DSLRs and finally managed to click some decent shots of the night.
