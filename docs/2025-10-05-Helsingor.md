The second leg of our Northern California road trip took us away from the coast but kept us close to nature—in the world of lakes, waterfalls and caves! We soon realized that this was definitely one of the most offbeat places we had ever decided to explore.

The scenery shifted quite drastically as we left Eureka and drove to [Redding](https://visitredding.com/)—from thick redwood trees to mountain ranges and rivers with clear water. It was a beautiful drive, especially for the passenger princess :) We made a quick stop at [Whiskeytown lake](https://www.nps.gov/whis/index.htm), a crystal-clear lake surrounded by hills. The lake was quiet, the water chilly, and dipping our feet in after hours on the road felt nothing short of divine. What was meant to be a quick stop slowly turned into a peaceful afternoon by the lake.

One of the highlights of our trip was our trip to [Burney falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burney_Falls). We’d seen dreamy pictures of it on Instagram, and learning that Theodore Roosevelt once called it the "Eighth Wonder of the World" only made us more hyped. So imagine our surprise when we parked barely 50 meters away and couldn’t hear a single hint of falling water. But as we walked a little farther, the falls revealed themselves—suddenly and dramatically—and yes, they were just as magical as we had hoped.

There were many well marked hiking trails around the falls, and we picked one that looped around the falls, giving us views from almost every angle. The weather was just right—sunny, breezy, perfect for a stroll through dense forest and over a little wooden bridge crossing a creek. I remember stopping every now and then to catch my breath, reading the thoughtful quotes carved into benches along the trail. One in particular stayed with us: “It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover” — J. Poincaré. As researchers, the quote struck a chord. It was the most meaningful way to spend an afternoon in the Shasta region.
